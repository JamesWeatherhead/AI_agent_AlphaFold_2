# ColabFold Runtime Connection Issue - Debug Report

## Issue Summary
The ColabFold notebook is not executing because the Google Colab runtime is not connected.

## Detailed Debug Analysis

### 1. Runtime Status
- **Status**: DISCONNECTED
- **Available Runtime**: T4 GPU (Tesla T4)
- **Connection Menu**: Shows "Connect to a hosted runtime: T4" indicating no active session

### 2. Symptoms Observed
- Notebook cells show no execution indicators (no running spinners)
- No output appears when trying to run cells
- Ctrl+F9 (Run All) command has no effect
- Connection menu remains open showing disconnected state

### 3. Root Cause
Google Colab requires an active runtime connection before any code execution can begin. The notebook is in a disconnected state, which prevents:
- Cell execution
- Code running
- Package installation
- Any computational tasks

### 4. Technical Details
- **Browser**: Chrome-based browser in sandbox environment
- **Console Errors**: Minor resource blocking (ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT) but no critical JavaScript errors
- **Page State**: Fully loaded, all UI elements responsive
- **Authentication**: User is logged in (confirmed by successful navigation)

### 5. Connection Attempts Made
1. Clicked "Additional connection options" button
2. Attempted to click "Connect to a hosted runtime: T4"
3. Tried keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+F9)
4. Menu interactions successful but connection not established

### 6. Likely Causes
- Runtime allocation queue (Google Colab has limited free GPU resources)
- Account limitations (free tier restrictions)
- Regional availability of T4 GPUs
- Network connectivity issues between browser and Google's servers

### 7. Required Actions
The user needs to manually establish the runtime connection by:
1. Clicking the "Connect" button in the top-right corner of Colab
2. Waiting for runtime allocation (can take 1-5 minutes)
3. Ensuring GPU runtime type is selected (Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU)
4. Confirming connection shows "Connected" status

### 8. Next Steps
Once runtime is connected:
- Green checkmark should appear in top-right
- Cells will show execution numbers when run
- AlphaFold pipeline can proceed normally
- Full notebook execution will take 10-60 minutes

## Recommendation
This is a standard Colab runtime connection issue that requires user intervention to resolve, as the runtime allocation process involves Google's resource management system.
