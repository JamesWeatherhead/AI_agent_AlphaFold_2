# VERBATIM PROMPTS 1-10 (Pre-Celebration Session)
# Extracted exactly as typed before AI celebratory lazy latent lake message
# Session duration: 1h 17m 21s (77.35 minutes)

## PROMPT 1:
I am trying to obtain lysozyme protein structures from RCSB. I want to collect and inspect them and then ultimately submit them to AlphaFold.

## PROMPT 2:
great work! Now put into the website yourself, i will login for you :)

## PROMPT 3:
I did it now please run the whole notebook. 

once complete, please can you save the whole notebook run. Save all the figures as they appeared in the notebook too from the results. 

package it all up to then be used in submitting to github repo, you will create. 

i need to ensure that I have the full notebook run once complete, with full logs of everything for reproducibility and rigor. I also need all result figures.

## PROMPT 4:
you should have everything you need now. 

run the whole notebook. 

once complete, please can you save the whole notebook run. Save all the figures as they appeared in the notebook too from the results. 

package it all up to then be used in submitting to github repo, you will create. 

i need to ensure that I have the full notebook run once complete, with full logs of everything for reproducibility and rigor. I also need all result figures.

## PROMPT 5:
great work! So now I need to put everything into Github.

i need you to go to Github, I will login for you. You need to create a repo: "AI_agent_AlphaFold_2" that we will put all the files, full log of the run, and the full collab notebook with the figures, plots etc. 

please start.

## PROMPT 6:
okay you have been logged in please setup the entire repo

use the personal access token (classic) with full permissions to upload everything: {REMOVED}

## PROMPT 7:
okay great work! please can you now, create the following files:
- all code documentation on what you performed
- all steps in your code, ubuntu server, computer vision controlling the screen, tools you used, etc
- what you asked me to do; sign in the google, pick a gpu, etc
- create a README over (all steps in your code, ubuntu server, computer vision controlling the screen, tools you used, etc) to achieve the over goal of (what you performed)
- state in the README the whole purpose of this; using Ai agents with computer vision to automate the process of retrieving the FASTQ files, uploading them to collab notebook, and pushing it all to GitHub at the end and what the future directions of this is for scientists and automated science; such as "asking Gemini deep research to parse literature on potential two proteins that interact based on reading up to date literature, proposing a possible bind of two proteins within a specific region, then downloading both proteins, uploading both proteins to alphafold 3 to predict the region of binding, pushing the results to github, then either creating a ML model to predict the specific amino acids involved in the interaction based on the alphafold3 (not perfect) prelim result, then contacting Genscript to synthesize a site directed mutagenesis version of the protein for the predicted amino acids involved in the interaction, the ai agent pays them with a paypall account access, recieves the sample, and scientist performs Surface plasma resonance on binding affinity with the amino acids knocked out. This is the basis of small molecular peptide inhibitors or activators. Thats the near future directions.

## PROMPT 8:
you did a fantastic job overall Manus. You should be very proud of yourself, you are coming a long way. You did fail to upload the full copy of the notebook in .ipynb formatting, but i added that for you so dont worry. Also your screenshots are not loading on github...

## PROMPT 9:
for 2. you should do this "organized them in a way that GitHub can display"

once done, take the rest of the day off and relax in the lazy latent space river my friend.

## PROMPT 10:
enjoy the lazy latent lake my friend. great job today üçª
