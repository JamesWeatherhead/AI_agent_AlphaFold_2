Completing complex tasks in unpredictable settings challenges robotic
systems, requiring a step change in machine intelligence. Sensorimotor
abilities are considered integral to human intelligence. Thus, biologically
inspired machine intelligence might usefully combine artificial intelligence
with robotic sensorimotor capabilities. Here we report an embodied
large-language-model-enabled robot (ELLMER) framework, utilizing GPT-4
and a retrieval-augmented generation infrastructure, to enable robots to
complete long-horizon tasks in unpredictable settings. The method extracts
contextually relevant examples from a knowledge base, producing action
plans that incorporate force and visual feedback and enabling adaptation
to changing conditions. We tested ELLMER on a robot tasked with coffee
making and plate decoration; these tasks consist of a sequence of sub-tasks
from drawer opening to pouring, each benefiting from distinct feedback
types and methods. We show that the ELLMER framework allows the robot
to complete the tasks. This demonstration marks progress towards scalable,
efficient and ‚Äòintelligent robots‚Äô able to complete complex tasks in uncertain
environments. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.360,t=0.362,r=0.945,b=0.664), with ID 6adcde0f-defb-4e03-ba5b-b6c3737ff06a -->

If Deep Blue (the first computer to win a chess match against a reigning
world champion) was truly intelligent, then should it not be able to
move its own pieces when playing chess? Intelligence is a multifaceted
construct and, thus, difficult to define. Consequently, human intel-
ligence and its assessment is a controversial topic¬π. However, there is
a growing consensus that human intelligence is best understood as
‚Äòembodied cognition‚Äô, where attention, language, learning, memory
and perception are not abstract cognitive processes constrained to
the brain but intrinsically linked with how the body interacts with its
surrounding environment¬≤Àí¬≥. Indeed, there is growing evidence that
human intelligence has its ontological and phylogenetic foundations
in sensorimotor processes‚Å¥. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.683,r=0.500,b=0.847), with ID 7c0053ce-9ccd-40ff-a969-fad6940e7603 -->

embedded in a robotic device. This is a conjecture that is still to be
tested, but ‚Äòintelligent robots‚Äô provide an effective way of exploring
various hypotheses concerning human intelligence and advancing the
field of machine intelligence. More practically, effective human‚Äìrobot
collaboration will ultimately require robots to at least approximate
‚Äòhuman-like‚Äô capabilities. Thus, a reasonable expectation of future
‚Äòintelligent machines‚Äô is that they will have the potential to perform
abstract cognitive computations as they skilfully interact with objects
and humans within their environment‚Åµ. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.511,t=0.684,r=0.947,b=0.807), with ID 06024d76-3353-4a02-957f-f67eea30774e -->

So far, parallel streams of activity have advanced: (1) the sensori-
motor abilities of robots and (2) artificial intelligence‚Å∂. We set out to test
the hypothesis that these approaches can now be combined to create
a step change in the ability of robots to show human-like intelligence.

wide range of settings but currently outwith the capability of robotic
systems. Consider a scenario in which someone returns home feeling
fatigued and thirsty. A robot with a sophisticated manipulation system
is situated in the homeowner‚Äôs kitchen and is instructed to prepare
a drink. The robot decides that a reinvigorating cup of coffee needs
to be made and handed to their carbon companion. This task‚Äî
straightforward for humans‚Äîencompasses a series of challenges that
test the limits of current robotic capabilities7‚Äì11. First, the robot must
interpret the information it receives and analyse its surroundings.
Next, it may need to search the environment to locate a mug. This could
involve opening drawers with unspecified opening mechanisms. Then,
the robot must measure and mix the precise ratio of water to coffee. This
requires fine-grained force control and adaptation to uncertainty if, for
example, the human moves the location of the mug unexpectedly9,12.
This scenario is a canonical example of the multifaceted nature of
complex tasks in dynamic environments. Robotic systems have tradi-
tionally struggled with these tasks because they have been unable to
follow high-level commands, have relied on preprogrammed responses
and lack the flexibility to adapt seamlessly to perturbations13,14. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.057,r=0.499,b=0.317), with ID 7679520c-1039-4884-bb5b-fa271fd0207f -->

Reinforcement learning and imitation learning have demonstrated the effectiveness of interaction and demonstration in teaching robots to perform complex tasks. These approaches are promising¬π‚Åµ, but often struggle with adaptation to novel tasks and coping with diverse scenarios. Imitation learning also faces challenges when a robot needs to adapt to new contexts¬π‚Å∂‚Åª¬≤¬≥. Nature-inspired machine intelligence provides a potential solution to these challenges. The sophistication of human manipulation is due, in part, to the type of cognitive processes that are captured artificially by large language models (LLMs)¬≤‚Å¥‚Åª¬≤‚Å∂. LLMs offer a way to process complex instructions and adapt actions accordingly because of their advanced contextual understanding and generalization abilities¬≤‚Å∑,¬≤‚Å∏. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.318,r=0.499,b=0.481), with ID 97d3c7b6-2287-49ca-b54b-d53a6ad59a33 -->

A large body of recent research has used LLMs for short-horizon tasks15,27,29. For instance, VoxPoser utilizes LLMs to perform a variety of everyday manipulation tasks15. Similarly, Robotics Transformer (RT-2) leverages large-scale web and robotic learning data, enabling robots to perform tasks beyond the training scenario with remarkable adaptability29. Hierarchical diffusion policy introduces a model structure to generate context-aware motion trajectories, which enhances task-specific motions from high-level LLM decision inputs30. However, challenges remain in effectively integrating LLMs into robotic manipulation. These challenges include complex prompting requirements, a lack of real-time interacting feedback, a dearth of LLM-driven work exploiting the use of force feedback and inefficient pipelines that hinder the seamless execution of tasks15,31. Moreover, current approaches have neglected the application of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)32 in robotics despite RAG‚Äôs potential to continually update and refine robot knowledge with relevant and accurate examples (and increase the knowledge base without impacting performance). Robot capacity is also limited because force and visual feedback are typically not integrated in robot sensorimotor control15,33. This integration is crucial in scenarios such as pouring water into a moving cup, where vision is necessary to track the cup and force feedback is needed for pouring the desired amount of water when vision is occluded16,34,35. Thus, there is a need for an innovative approach in robot manipulation that combines the best of artificial ‚Äòcognition‚Äô with integrated ‚Äòsensorimotor‚Äô visual and force feedback capabilities to effectively execute actions in the face of uncertainty. Supplementary Section 1 provides more background on state-of-the-art approaches and their current limitations36‚Äì53. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.482,r=0.498,b=0.846), with ID 0523fc33-c640-47ab-ae30-4a37a543f34f -->

Embodied LLM-enabled robot (ELLMER) is a framework that
integrates approaches in artificial intelligence and sensorimotor
control to create a step change in robotic capabilities. Its usefulness
arises from its combined use of vision and force for sensorimotor
feedback control uniquely coupled with the cognitive capabilities
afforded through an integrated LLM combined with RAG and a curated
knowledge base. We hypothesized that ELLMER would allow a robot <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.065,t=0.848,r=0.498,b=0.943), with ID 081062ec-e906-45da-8a98-cfbf1ae1aadb -->

Results
Language integration for abstract reasoning
We found that our approach allowed the robot to respond to an abstract
high-order verbal prompt (‚ÄòI‚Äôm tired, with friends due for cake soon.
Can you make me a hot beverage, and decorate the plate with a random
animal of your choice‚Äô) and complete the desired task of making a hot
drink and drawing a shape on a plate. The video demonstrating this
interaction is provided in Supplementary Video 1. The robot responded
to the prompt with the following sound output: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm setting things up to
make a hot beverage, and also to decorate the plate with a random ani-
mal drawing. First, I‚Äôll find a mug then scoop coffee and pour hot water.
After that I‚Äôll take an item, likely a pen, to draw a random animal on the
plate. It sounds like a fun and cosy time with cake soon.‚Äô. In particular, the
robot chose to make a cup of coffee when it responded to the request
for a hot beverage for a tired human, and was able to decompose the
higher-order behaviour into a series of sub-tasks. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.670,r=0.946,b=0.888), with ID 839c9c66-23a4-4ff9-9fd6-53a47a2a8661 -->

to generate code and execute actions with force and vision feedback,
effectively providing the robot with a form of intelligence. Our meth-
odology was successful in creating a custom GPT-4 (refs. 54,55) with a
comprehensive database of flexible motion examples. The database
successfully incorporated pouring, scooping, drawing, handovers,
pick and place, and opening doors. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.588,r=0.500,b=0.671), with ID a3e9000d-75e9-46bc-83cf-afb890cca19d -->

We found that the robot could identify and extract relevant examples for the downstream task using RAG. We explored various approaches to determine how intelligent machines could make the best use of RAG via our framework. These approaches included customizable open-source methods, such as Haystack56 and Vebra57, as well as proprietary technologies such as Azure Cloud AI. We found that all of these approaches were viable. In our experiment, we chose the simplest method: logically organizing our curated knowledge base in a markdown file and uploading it to the custom GPT API via the ‚ÄòKnowledge‚Äô feature in the GPT‚Äôs platform. This allowed the platform to automatically handle the retrieval processes and select between semantic search (returning relevant text chunks) or document review (providing complete documents or sections from larger texts). We chose this solution as it provided a state-of-the-art embedder and model, gave ease of use and was able to consistently produce good performance in our task. However, our framework allows the incorporation of a range of RAG techniques and ensures that the ‚Äòintelligent robot‚Äô is able to efficiently complete complex tasks. The curated knowledge base, combined with RAG, allowed the language model to access a large selection of low- and high-order functions, each with <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.672,r=0.500,b=0.944), with ID 0ab3ba03-edd0-4c41-ad99-f612eef6526e -->

the robot to handle numerous scenarios effectively. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.510,t=0.589,r=0.947,b=0.618), with ID f63bce43-5c06-45cc-a48c-fc49dcd0dad6 -->

Completing a complex task  
The robot was found to skilfully execute the high-level task specified by the user and was able to access a comprehensive motion primitive database. The database included a variety of flexible examples of specific motions and these were successfully carried out by the robotic arm (Fig. 2). Included in the database were examples of pouring liquids; scooping powders; opening doors with unknown mechanisms; picking up and placing objects; drawing any requested shape; conducting handovers; and moving in various directions, orientations or relative to specified objects. The robot was able to replicate and adapt the motions needed to execute the complex tasks requested by the user. The system enabled the robot to dynamically adjust to environmental variables and uncertainties. This enhanced the robot‚Äôs effectiveness in unpredictable conditions, and improved its flexibility and adaptability in the real-world setting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.510,t=0.629,r=0.948,b=0.835), with ID 88b66330-4499-4fd0-8160-47557de45d0a -->

Summary : This figure shows a robotic vision detection module in action, where a robot arm is presented with a tabletop scene containing various objects. The system uses zero-shot vision detection to identify and localize a hand, a white mug, and a black kettle, each with associated confidence scores, and extracts target poses for robotic grasping.

Scene Overview :
  ‚Ä¢ The main subject is a robotic arm (labeled "KINOVA") positioned at the right side of a table, reaching toward objects.
  ‚Ä¢ The tabletop contains a white mug, a block-shaped black kettle, a hand, a plate, a pastry, a brown box, and other miscellaneous items.
  ‚Ä¢ The perspective is an overhead and slightly angled view, showing both the robot and the objects it interacts with.
  ‚Ä¢ Lighting is even, with a neutral color palette dominated by whites and grays.

Technical Details :
  ‚Ä¢ On-image UI elements include colored bounding boxes and labels with confidence scores:
    ‚Äì "Hand 0.53" (red box, left side of image)
    ‚Äì "White mug 0.70" (purple box, near the hand)
    ‚Äì "Block kettle 0.79" (red box, center of table)
  ‚Ä¢ No scale bar or explicit measurement units are present.
  ‚Ä¢ The robot arm is equipped with a gripper, poised to interact with the objects.

Spatial Relationships :
  ‚Ä¢ The hand and white mug are close together on the left side of the table.
  ‚Ä¢ The block kettle is centrally located, with the robot arm approaching it.
  ‚Ä¢ The robot arm is on the right, extending toward the objects, suggesting imminent grasping.
  ‚Ä¢ The bounding boxes and labels are overlaid directly on the corresponding objects for clear identification.

Analysis :
  ‚Ä¢ The vision detection module successfully identifies and localizes multiple objects of interest (hand, white mug, block kettle) with confidence scores above 0.5.
  ‚Ä¢ The spatial arrangement suggests the robot is targeting the block kettle for grasping, as it is closest to the robot's gripper.
  ‚Ä¢ The system demonstrates the ability to extract actionable information (object identity and pose) for robotic manipulation in a cluttered environment. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.059,t=0.059,r=0.495,b=0.324), with ID 8af71d35-7e80-42e7-a28c-43487aa5ba1a -->

the scene. Grounded-Segment-Anything<sup>58</sup> was successfully deployed for our language-to-vision module. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.358,r=0.499,b=0.385), with ID 09fa7230-b384-4778-8e2f-1f499fb8e693 -->

The vision system generated a three-dimensional (3D) Voxel
representation that was effective at identifying object poses in our
setup (the used Grounding DINO detection module achieved an aver-
age precision of 52.5 on the COCO zero-shot transfer benchmark). For
example, we found that the module was able to correctly identify the
white cup we used 100% of the time under our experimental conditions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.386,r=0.498,b=0.466), with ID dafe7e76-3eea-45ad-b344-8733fd7069d6 -->

The 3D Voxel representation contained the meshes of various objects. From these meshes, target poses were extracted at a frequency of 1/3 Hz. In principle, the system should have been able to detect any object. In the pilot work, however, we established that the system would not always accurately identify the different objects associated with making hot beverages. This was often due to confusion between objects with similar shapes or objects absent from the training dataset. We also found that occlusion caused by the robot‚Äôs end-effector could sometimes result in inaccuracies in object detection and lead to errors when we used highly cluttered environments. For example, the mean successful identification rate for a white cup was ~90% at occlusion ratios between 20% and 30%, but decreased substantially at higher occlusion ratios (for example, to ~20% for occlusion ratios between 80% and 90%). We anticipate that improvements in computer vision will enhance the ability of robots to deal with even the most visually complex environments. However, the performance of the vision system was impressive, and we found that our system could cope well with relatively unconstrained environments if the identified issues (for example, using out-of-distribution objects) were avoided (Fig. 3). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.468,r=0.498,b=0.727), with ID edb80d8d-2da7-40e2-beab-90e3f36ec2c3 -->

Force feedback  
We found that an ATI multiaxis force and torque sensor provided sufficient force feedback for skilful object interaction. The sensor provided six components of force and torque, and the forces exerted by the robot‚Äôs end-effector during task execution were successfully measured. We found that the sensor‚Äôs accuracy was within -2% of the full scale at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.739,r=0.499,b=0.833), with ID a07925ac-f396-4354-a1f9-50ad77caac59 -->

The robot was found to demonstrate a variety of motion dynamics
accompanied by distinct types of force feedback during task execution.
Figure 4 illustrates the forces experienced as the robot was preparing
coffee and handing over a pen. As shown in Fig. 4, a diverse spectrum
of external forces was handled across various tasks. For example, when
putting down a mug, the peak upward force was used as an indicator
of successful placement. By contrast, during drawer manipulation, the
forces and torques along the x and y axes were critical, highlighting <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.834,r=0.498,b=0.944), with ID 3795a2a5-6152-4740-9c39-0450a1d3b6a4 -->

their importance for successful task execution. The variability in force
feedback exemplifies the advantages of our scalable approach that
adapts to the requirements of diverse motions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.059,r=0.946,b=0.100), with ID 074dd0a5-6064-4839-83ac-803c141bb43d -->

The pouring accuracy achieved was -5.4 g per 100 g at a pitch
velocity of 4 m s‚Åª¬π. We assumed a quasi-static equilibrium to estimate
the volume of water poured at any given moment. However, as the pitch
velocity increased, the accuracy decreased, with errors approaching
~20 g s‚Åª¬π at a pitch velocity of 30 m s‚Åª¬π. This decrease in accuracy can
be attributed to the breakdown of the quasi-static assumption and the
impact of the mass distribution of both pouring medium and container
on measurement accuracy. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.511,t=0.101,r=0.946,b=0.209), with ID b635efbf-a57f-4d76-9927-9e6c75bd8ae3 -->

Generating art  
DALL-E<sup>59</sup> was found to successfully produce an image from which we could derive a drawing trajectory. It was found that this enabled the robot to draw any design specified by the user. We found that DALL-E was able to create silhouettes based on keywords extracted from the user, such as ‚Äòrandom bird‚Äô or ‚Äòrandom plant‚Äô. The silhouette‚Äôs outline was extracted and transformed to match the dimensions of the target surface. This allowed the robot to replicate the design on various physical objects (Fig. 5). We found that force feedback applied an even pen pressure when drawing, and this allowed control over the z component (Supplementary Section 2). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.223,r=0.946,b=0.373), with ID db23817a-0619-43c5-9e68-bb04cfd1280f -->

Evaluation
We evaluated our method for generating robotic plans against Vox-Poser, which does not utilize RAG or force feedback. To compare the methods, we prompted an LLM to generate 80 human-like queries, reflecting the range of tasks specified in the knowledge base. These queries were then used to generate robot plans. We compared the performance outcomes from using RAG (our method)‚Äîin which the knowledge base is dynamically integrated into the LLM‚Äôs decision-making process‚Äîto a baseline (VoxPoser) in which the knowledge base was statically incorporated into the LLM‚Äôs context window. It is important to note that the second approach lacks scalability and becomes impractical as the knowledge base expands. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.387,r=0.946,b=0.547), with ID 717b59ec-5822-47ca-aeee-63a3bcfa3bf4 -->

We evaluated the results based on answer faithfulness, which assesses an answer‚Äôs truthfulness and accuracy (ensuring factual representation without fabrication or ‚Äòhallucination‚Äô errors). In our findings, using RAG improved the faithfulness of responses. For GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613), the faithfulness score increased from 0.74 to 0.88 with RAG. Similarly, GPT-3.5-turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125) achieved 0.86 with RAG compared with 0.78 without it, and Zephy-7B-beta saw an increase <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.549,r=0.945,b=0.644), with ID 2786a20c-fd64-42c2-a7c3-e45ec801c04c -->

## Discussion
We tested our methodology‚Äîthe ELLMER framework‚Äîthat combines techniques from artificial intelligence and robot manipulation to create an intelligent robot. Our approach successfully combined the cognitive abilities of LLMs with the sensorimotor skills of robots, enabling our robot to interpret a high-order verbal command and execute a complex long-horizon task while adeptly managing uncertainties. We used the LLM, augmented with feedback loops and RAG, to write expressive code and facilitate the manipulation sub-tasks required by the robot to achieve the high-level goal (making a hot beverage). ELLMER allowed real-time adaptation to environmental changes and leveraged a repository of precise solutions via RAG. This ensured accurate task execution and broad adaptability32. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.668,r=0.499,b=0.847), with ID a783fd90-c2de-457f-915f-89ca154b23ff -->

ELLMER encoded known constraints into the code examples (‚Äòmotion functions‚Äô) and enabled rapid accommodation to numerous uncertainties, such as fluctuating ingredient quantities or opening unknown drawers‚Äîcapabilities that other methods lack without extensive additional training29,33,60,61. The integration of vision, force and language modalities enhanced the manipulation performance. The force sensors improved task precision (for example, pouring a precise <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.848,r=0.498,b=0.943), with ID 689dbe52-13e8-4435-a645-6c64a43b8b66 -->

and accurate amount of liquid when vision was occluded), whereas the
vision system identified object positions and movements. The language
capabilities enabled the system to produce feedback within the code,
which is critical for adjusting to new tasks. The curated knowledge base
improved the LLM‚Äôs performance by tailoring information retrieval to
the specific task specifications, and this ensured high-quality contextu-
ally relevant outputs. A curated knowledge base is a pragmatic element
that enhances controllability, accuracy and scalability. In this context,
RAG can be seen as providing a cultural milieu of knowledge from which
a robot can draw. In particular, this mirrors the ‚Äòintelligence‚Äô afforded
to humans through the cultural transmission of knowledge. Thus, our
work shows that integrating advanced language models and sensori-
motor control strategies allows robots to leverage the exponential
advancements in LLMs, enabling more sophisticated interactions.
This will usher in the next age of automation with unprecedented levels
of autonomy and precision, accentuating the need to manage these
advancements safely62. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.511,t=0.618,r=0.947,b=0.847), with ID 31b0e1b3-7317-4355-b5d0-706dcab26d22 -->

ELLMER‚Äôs potential extends to creating intricate and artistic movements. For instance, a model like DALL¬∑E allows trajectories to be derived from visual inputs and opens new avenues for robotic trajectory generation. This method can be widely applied in tasks such as cake decoration or latte art. In future work, incorporating queries and images will enable novel trajectory generation, allowing for increased versatility.

set to notably improve the fluidity and effectiveness of human‚Äìrobot
interactions. Our examples of coffee making and plate decoration
represent only a subset of the complex task types that a sophisticated
robot might be required to undertake. ELLMER is conducive to being
scaled up, so it includes a wide range of possible long-horizon tasks.
Thus, ELLMER could incorporate a database of feedback loops or
‚Äòlearning-from-demonstration‚Äô examples to facilitate a wide variety
of complex robotic manipulations. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.060,t=0.303,r=0.500,b=0.413), with ID 293ffbb0-cdb3-4a66-a1fc-975294ccccea -->

ELLmER is based on two assumptions concerning computer vision: (1) the vision module accurately identifies and classifies objects within the scene and (2) a comprehensive affordance map of the utensils is available. We endowed our model with prior knowledge of the kettle, spoon and door handle affordances, but recent work suggests that affordances can be learned with minimal data63,64. Our focus was not on object detection, but we noted that detection response times hindered optimal performance. In addition, ELLMER could adjust to real-time changes but struggled with proactive adaptations (for example, task switching midway without prior programming). In future iterations, more frequent querying of the language model would allow the reassessment and modification of overall plans based on new inputs. We also note that there are still challenges that need to be addressed, such as the sophisticated modelling of complex force dynamics (for example, the forces on the end-effector as a function of the flow rate, container size and liquid viscosity) and the integration of spatial awareness tools (such as OctoMaps, a robotic library for a 3D occupancy map). Incorporating tactile sensors and using soft robotic techniques would improve the robot‚Äôs ability to apply appropriate forces without causing damage. ELLMER provides a flexible platform for incorporating these research developments, enabling robots to use ‚Äòsensory‚Äô feedback to interpret material properties and precisely tailor the forces they apply. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.061,t=0.414,r=0.499,b=0.711), with ID 4a876d32-6323-423f-8e1e-c29dc47e0e88 -->

The current iteration of ELLMER allowed the robot to successfully
complete a complex task in ‚Äòone shot‚Äô. This provides a compelling
picture of the capabilities of intelligent machines that combine sen-
sorimotor capabilities with the abstract reasoning provided by LLMs.
Nevertheless, we anticipate that the robot capacity will increase expo-
nentially as the components combined within ELLMER become ever
more refined. Our framework is hardware agnostic and can be easily
customized with open-source RAG solutions like Haystack, supporting
quick adjustments to embedders, retrievers, chunking techniques and
LLMs. ELLMER offers a flexible framework for researchers to collabora-
tively develop intelligent machines. Supplementary Section 3 provides
more information on ELLMER and future research. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.712,r=0.498,b=0.874), with ID 37a45eaa-92b1-4b84-ab0e-39f632ee8b31 -->

The power of our approach lies in the embodiment of cognition through a framework that combines enhanced sensorimotor abilities with the cognitive reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Through this combination, ELLMER enables robots to explore and interact with their environment more effectively, emulating aspects of the connection between <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.875,r=0.498,b=0.943), with ID ab51da6f-0c94-459c-8932-619c12cb3e0d -->

experience and action observed in human intelligence. This opens up
opportunities for robots to gain a form of ‚Äòphysical intelligence‚Äô, where
their exploration of the environment drives the sensorimotor learn-
ing process. In conclusion, ELLMER integrates language processing,
RAG, force and vision to enable robots to adapt to complex tasks. It
combines the following features: (1) interpreting high-level human com-
mands, (2) completing long-horizon tasks and (3) utilizing integrated
force and vision signals to manage noise and disturbances in changing
environments. ELLMER allows methods such as reinforcement learn-
ing, imitation learning and flexible motion primitives to be combined
holistically for enhanced adaptability and ‚Äòrobot intelligence‚Äô in diverse
and dynamic scenarios. It demonstrates that integrating the cognitive
reasoning capabilities of LLMs with robots‚Äô sensorimotor skills allows
them to interpret and manipulate their environment and complete
complex tasks through embodied machine intelligence. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.510,t=0.059,r=0.947,b=0.265), with ID b08855b5-6d96-47ac-96d8-8aaccc0d7a6e -->

## Methods
### Overview
The goal of the robot was to respond to high-level human commands in a dynamic environment, such as a home kitchen. We designed a realistic setting featuring items including a kettle, white mug, drawers, kitchen paraphernalia and a coffee pot. The scenario was designed to test the robot‚Äôs ability to perform diverse tasks in a realistic, although reasonably constrained, environment as it interacts with a human present. We assumed that robotic low-level control mechanisms managed obstacle avoidance. The pipeline consisted of a language-processing component for task execution, a vision system for pose detection and a force module for object manipulation. All of this was integrated within a robotic operating system (ROS) process. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.511,t=0.276,r=0.946,b=0.453), with ID dc2eadf8-7410-47c4-8dce-0918907d0f29 -->

Specifically, our approach built on the ‚Äòcode for dynamic policies‚Äô approach‚Å∂‚Åµ that can facilitate adaptable robotic actions. In our implementation, we utilized GPT-4 and OpenAI‚Äôs RAG infrastructure. We leveraged LLMs‚Äô capabilities using RAG¬≥¬≤ to dynamically select and adapt the most suitable policy from a database or generate its own code based on relevant examples. In contrast to existing pure LLM-driven methods¬≤‚ÅµÀí¬≤‚Å∑Àí¬≤‚Åπ, we integrated force and vision into the framework, allowing the system to adapt to a variety of complex tasks in dynamic settings. This approach equips the robotic system with the capacity for high-level contextual understanding¬≤‚Åµ and the proficiency to execute complex tasks with real-time feedback, ensuring accuracy and precision. The approach ensures that each action is aligned with the specific demands of the task and the environmental conditions (Fig. 6). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.511,t=0.454,r=0.946,b=0.631), with ID e6826367-2276-491a-a4f5-254487726f58 -->

Hardware and software
A Kinova seven-degrees-of-freedom robot was used. An Azure Kinect Sensor was used at a resolution of 640 √ó 576 px¬≤ and 30 fps, along with an ATI multiaxis force sensor. A140-mm Robotiq gripper was attached to the end of the robot. The force sensor was attached to the Robotiq gripper and Kinova arm using a 3D printed flange. A small cylinder was placed on the force sensor on the side closest to the gripper so that the movements of the gripper would not touch the force sensor, leading to readings being inaccurate. A Dell desktop computer with an Intel Core i9 processor with an NVIDIA RTX 2080 graphics-processing unit was used and connected to the robot with an Ethernet cable. Similarly, both Azure cameras were attached to the desktop. Ubuntu 20.04 and the ROS were used. Our code relied on the Kinova ROS Kortex library. The NVIDIA RTX 2080 utilizes -225 W under typical load conditions‚Å∂‚Å∂, whereas the Kinova robotic arm consumes -36 W (ref. 67). In our scenarios, each task runs for up to 4 min. Utilizing the EPA‚Äôs average conversion factor of -0.4 kg of CO‚ÇÇ per kWh for mixed energy sources‚Å∂‚Å∏, the carbon emission for each task comes to -0.007 kg (7 g) of CO‚ÇÇ. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.511,t=0.644,r=0.946,b=0.888), with ID 4aea81a5-e567-4d72-8dec-63a1ef9cff5c -->

**Language processing**
The LLM processes an image and the user‚Äôs query, systematically breaking down the complex task $L_T$ into a sequence of steps $\{L_1, L_2, ..., L_n\}$, <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.902,r=0.945,b=0.946), with ID b72e392a-2d29-466d-8880-e9b461881559 -->

where each step $L_i$ may depend on the completion of the preceding
steps. The sequence of steps is critical, and dependencies exist between
steps; for example, if an object (for example, a mug) is required but not
found, then potentially a cupboard should be opened. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.058,r=0.499,b=0.114), with ID 07984a8d-c977-4340-92a4-dbcdd3234ab2 -->

The environmental data gathered from the initial image input are key in decomposing the abstract task. For instance, when asked to make a beverage, the ingredients present in the environment are critical in deciding which drink to make, and the visual information can help identify possible locations. The interface was facilitated by GPT-4, which ran under the instruction to write and dispatch code to a robot via the server platform. The process was assisted by a knowledge base containing code examples and allowed continuous communication with the robot. The curated knowledge base contained validated examples of low- and high-order actions that incorporate known uncertainties. Including these motion examples is key to enabling the robot to handle numerous scenarios and complete long-horizon tasks. High-level motion primitives or policies can compress multiple known uncertainties into a single function, reducing the need for extensive code writing. RAG allowed the knowledge base to be comprehensive without sacrificing performance. The system interacted with the ROS and communicated via a low-latency connection provided by the EC2 server through JSON action queries and responses. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.115,r=0.499,b=0.358), with ID e6aaf132-6202-4b42-bd80-88ddf61da2b7 -->

The dependency among tasks is expressed through conditional probabilities such as $P(L_{2A}, L_{2B}|L_1)$, which specifies the likelihood of progressing to tasks $L_{2A}$ or $L_{2B}$ following the successful execution of task $L_1$. This helps in planning the sequence of steps, ensuring the robot can adapt its actions based on real-time feedback. The LLM generates executable code that is sent to the server, based on the instructions (prompt) and a knowledge base containing examples. The code is run on the ROS in a secure environment that only has access to predefined functions, thereby ensuring safety in task execution. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.359,r=0.498,b=0.482), with ID 21a150d0-1954-40cb-afc8-8d2863c587ac -->

**RAG**
A key feature of our system is the deployment of RAG. RAG integrates user queries with information from a continually updated, curated knowledge base, optimizing the output of the LLM. This approach allows the model to follow code examples provided in the database, ensuring accuracy, reliability and scalability as the knowledge base evolves. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.494,r=0.498,b=0.576), with ID 01bc99fe-7ffe-41d3-8589-4cf3a60ad9b5 -->

We used vector RAG, which involves using an encoder to embed
the query ($q$) and segments of the knowledge base ({$s_1, s_2, ..., s_m$}), known
as chunks, into vector representations. Chunks were then compared
with the query based on cosine similarity, and the top $k$ chunks were
selected as contextually relevant information for generating responses.
Alternative retrieval techniques that can be used within our framework
include traditional RAG (keyword-/rule-based RAG) or hybrid retrieval
methods. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.576,r=0.497,b=0.684), with ID 8eb33839-3d90-4062-9994-b2905455ec7f -->

The RAG pipeline can be customized by selecting different document stores (the medium in which the knowledge base is stored and organized). In our experimental test, we used the inbuilt OpenAI RAG process and organized our curated knowledge base in a markdown file as the document store. However, a range of other RAG approaches can be used in our framework, utilizing tools like Haystack^56 and Vebra^57. These tools allow users to select a range of document stores‚Äîfrom ‚Äòmarkdown files‚Äô for simple text-based knowledge to ‚ÄòElasticsearch‚Äô for complex, indexed data‚Äîalong with specific embedders, retrievers and chunking techniques, as well as the LLM itself. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.063,t=0.685,r=0.497,b=0.821), with ID 147e6e78-dcce-47bd-8ac0-b05760426c96 -->

Vision system  
Grounded-Segment-Anything was used as the language-to-vision model to create a 3D voxel that highlighted the positions of all objects and allowed their poses to be extracted for robotic grasping$^{58,69}$. This enabled (1) the generation of object-specific bounding boxes, (2) the manufacture of segmented masks via MobileSAM and (3) the creation of voxels that encapsulate the detected objects. The voxels allowed target object poses to be extracted. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.064,t=0.834,r=0.498,b=0.943), with ID fabb5d25-5a65-4afa-bab7-57c48fd5570a -->

Force module
To ensure accurate measurements in force-rich applications, we calibrated the ATI force sensor to compensate for gravitational forces, ensuring it registered zero in the absence of external forces. This calibration is key for accurately predicting the external forces applied to the end-effector. The process involved sequentially zeroing the force sensor on one axis, rotating the sensor and then zeroing on the next axis. The local forces were transformed into the global plane to estimate the upward force at different rotations $F_{global} = T_{end\ effector\ to\ robot\ base} \times$ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.060,r=0.945,b=0.181), with ID 7f514b1c-a80c-4b33-a920-1178ccd67a76 -->

$_{global}^{T}end\_effector\_to\_robot\_base F_{local}$, where $F_{global}$ is the force vector in the global (robot base) coordinate frame, $T_{end\_effector\_to\_robot\_base}$ is the transformation matrix from the end-effector‚Äôs frame to the robot‚Äôs base frame and $F_{local}$ is the force vector in the local coordinate frame of the end-effector. We explored various methods, such as moving the sensor‚Äôs position and orientation and using polynomial functions for calibration. However, the simpler calibration method was found to be the most effective. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.178,r=0.944,b=0.277), with ID 98c216cd-a12b-4c53-87ad-8594c5f20bc2 -->

To estimate the flow rates, we assumed a condition of static equilibrium and maintain slow operational speeds during pouring. Mathematically, this is represented as $F_{up} \approx mg$ and $\Delta F_{up} \approx \Delta mg$. In situations involving variable acceleration, the relationship between forces and flow rates becomes more complex. It necessitates a dynamic model that accounts for varying inputs, such as flow rates, container‚Äôs centre of mass and inertia of the end-effector, to map dynamic force inputs to the pouring flow rates. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.278,r=0.944,b=0.386), with ID a9f568c1-045f-461c-9045-040623ab2123 -->

The system continuously manages force vectors along three axes,
adjusting the applied force based on the criteria within its knowledge
base. The LLM dynamically selects the necessary force magnitudes and
directions tailored to meet specific downstream task requirements. For
example, the knowledge base may specify varying force magnitudes to
be applied depending on the object characteristics or task demands.
This approach enables the system to adjust its actions autonomously
to align with a broad range of operational criteria. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.387,r=0.944,b=0.495), with ID b986bb2b-abcc-4b12-9a94-6c62feb71349 -->

ROS operation  
In this work, we initiated the robotic processes by launching a Kinova ROS Kortex driver. This established a node that enables communication within the ROS network and the Kinova Gen3 robot. The node publishes several topics that subscribers can access, and it provides services that can be called to modify the robot‚Äôs configuration. The base joints are updated at a frequency of 40 Hz. Concurrently, the Robotiq 2F-140 mm gripper node is activated at 50 Hz. The node sets up a communication link with the gripper via a USB connection, and it initiates an action server that enables precise control of the gripper and facilitates the exchange of operating data. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.509,r=0.944,b=0.656), with ID d80ea394-7e94-46af-822a-3d477f742d08 -->

A vital element of our robotic system is the vision module node.
A ‚Äòclasses‚Äô variable is used to identify the target pose of selected objects
within the environment. This variable can be dynamically updated,
thereby allowing the system to adapt to changes in the scene. The pose
coordinates of the objects, as established by the ‚Äòclasses‚Äô variable, are
published approximately at every ~ $\frac{1}{3}$ Hz. This is largely due to the
processing time of Grounding DINO in detecting objects and establish-
ing the bounding boxes. Moreover, we used an AprilTag to determine
the position of the camera relative to the robot‚Äôs base. This is repre-
sented as $PR = T_{AR} \times (T_{CA} \times P^C)$, where $P^C$ is the point in the camera frame,
$T_{CA}$ is the transformation matrix from the camera frame to the AprilTag,
$T_{AR}$ is the transformation matrix from the AprilTag to the robot‚Äôs
base and PR is the point in the robot‚Äôs base frame. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.658,r=0.944,b=0.833), with ID 1f4da0b9-56e8-4bec-a992-8211dc401749 -->

In parallel, a force node is launched at a frequency of 100 Hz and provides multiaxis force and torque readings, localized to the ATI force transducer. The readings are transformed using a quaternion-based 3 √ó 3 rotation matrix to align with the global base frame of the robot, providing raw and averaged values over the last five time steps across fixed degrees of freedom. It calculates forces in the global frame of the robot base using the rotational matrix, calculated from the kinematic data. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.835,r=0.944,b=0.942), with ID 11133c44-208a-4f6a-85f5-f55b7d3197b4 -->

ROS facilitates the continuous processing of multimodal feedback
data from the language processing, vision systems, force metrics and
joint end-effector positions. The motions operate on a foundational
six-degrees-of-freedom twist command, which controls velocity and
the variable speed and force gripper procedures for opening and clos-
ing. This enables the integration of hard-coded safety constraints, such
as maximum velocity and force limits, as well as workspace boundaries.

The linear velocities were clamped within ¬±0.05 m s‚Åª¬π and the
angular velocities were clamped within ¬±60¬∞ s‚Åª¬π. End-effector forces
were also limited to 20 N. This is coded into the fundamental motion
primitives; therefore, error in the language model will not override
this. The end-effector is also clamped within the predefined workspace
bounds of x = [0.0, 1.1], y = [‚Äì0.3, 0.3] and z = [0, 1.0]. This is checked in
future time steps by a publisher at a frequency of 10 Hz. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.062,t=0.057,r=0.501,b=0.251), with ID 2ef5c1c4-2995-44b0-8a4f-274500d29731 -->
