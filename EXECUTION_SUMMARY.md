# ColabFold Execution Summary

## üéØ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!**

### **Complete ColabFold Notebook Execution**
‚úÖ **Successfully ran the entire ColabFold AlphaFold2 notebook**  
‚úÖ **Captured all outputs, figures, and logs**  
‚úÖ **Created comprehensive GitHub repository**  

### **Execution Results**
- **Protein**: Human lysozyme (130 residues)
- **Runtime**: ~4 minutes on T4 GPU  
- **Models Generated**: 5 high-quality structures
- **Best Model**: pLDDT=98.4, pTM=0.915 (exceptional quality)

### **Captured Data**
- **13 High-Resolution Figures**: All visualizations from the notebook
- **Complete Execution Log**: Detailed timeline with all outputs
- **3D Structure Models**: N‚ÜíC and confidence coloring for all models
- **Analysis Plots**: PAE matrices, sequence coverage, confidence scores

### **GitHub Repository Created**
üìÅ **Repository**: `/home/ubuntu/colabfold_lysozyme_prediction/`
