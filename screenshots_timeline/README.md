# Screenshots Timeline - AI Agent Browser Automation

This directory contains the complete visual timeline of the AI agent's browser automation during the ColabFold execution process. These screenshots provide a complete audit trail of the computer vision-controlled workflow.

## üì∏ **Screenshot Categories**

### **RCSB PDB Data Collection**
- `rcsb_org_*` - Screenshots from protein structure database navigation
- Shows automated search, structure selection, and data collection

### **AlphaFold Database Research** 
- `alphafold_ebi_ac_uk_*` - Screenshots from AlphaFold database exploration
- Documents research into submission processes and requirements

### **ColabFold Execution**
- `colab_research_googl_*` - Screenshots from Google Colab notebook execution
- `github_*` - Screenshots from GitHub repository creation and upload
- Complete visual record of the prediction workflow

## ü§ñ **AI Agent Computer Vision Process**

Each screenshot represents a moment where the AI agent:
1. **Analyzed the visual interface** using computer vision
2. **Identified interactive elements** (buttons, forms, links)
3. **Made decisions** about next actions
4. **Executed precise interactions** (clicks, typing, navigation)
5. **Monitored progress** and adapted to changes

## üìä **Timeline Statistics**
- **Total Screenshots**: 97 images
- **Time Span**: Complete workflow from start to finish
- **Coverage**: Every major interaction and state change
- **Format**: WebP for optimal quality and size

## üîç **Key Moments Captured**

### **Data Collection Phase**
